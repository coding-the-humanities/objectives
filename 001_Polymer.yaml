(EDIT)We are going to learn about Polymer. 
using it makes it easier .....>>>>
Polymer is a framework facilitates the use of Web Components. It's foundation 
is Custom Elements. Polymer allows us to combine many html files each 
cointaining a single item like a button or a navigation bar. This way 
we can mix and match different components and build a web app that is 
scalable and maintanable. We acces these components by using 
custom elements these are basicaly custom html tags like <section>.
