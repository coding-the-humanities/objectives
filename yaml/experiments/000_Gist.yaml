      You would think one way to share code with your peers and/or friends would be by e-mail.
      But mailing one's code is a hassle when you have to deal with lots of different files and endless lines of code.
      Another way is to place these on Github, a website made for and by programmers to store and share code.
      Github offers two ways to do that. The first is making a repository. More on this will follow later.
      The second way is Gist, particulary handy for code snippets and a lot easier -though with some limitations.
    instructions:
      - Go to gist.github.com.
      - Copy paste the code you have written for these assignments into the box, or press 'Add File'.
      - Give the file the name Level0_CSS_assignment.html.
      - Write some snazzy description in the description box.
      - Click "Create public Gist" in the bottom right corner.
      - E-mail the link to >>>INSERTHEREOUREMAIL@CTH.NL<<< and/or your pals.
