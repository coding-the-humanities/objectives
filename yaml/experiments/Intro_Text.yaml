	Welcome to the course Coding The Humanities!
	You are going to learn web programming! How cool is that!?
	Well, we think it's pretty cool and you probably think it too,
	because you wouldn't have signed up if you didn't.
	The course is divided over a number of Levels.
	Each level has subjects and those subjects have assignments.
	Luckily for you, you don't have to do all the assignments.
	For every assignment you gain a number of points, and when you have amassed enough points,
	you pass the course. 
	And we want you to pass the course, but most of all we want that you learn as much as possible
	from us and from yourself.
	That is why we provide you with the opportunity and the environment to learn,
	rather than merely providing information.
	We supply some resources, but you should look for your own resources as well.
	Google is your friend. 
	Remember this creed. 
	Write it everywhere. 
	Repeat it as a mantra while you pray to the god of your choosing.
	Tattoo it on your forehead so you see it every morning as you look into the mirror.
	Okay, maybe you shouldn't do that last thing, but the important thing is that when
	you don't know something your first instinct should be F6 + "How do you do the thing!!!?".
	When you find the thing you're looking for, make sure that you understand the code before copy pasting
	it in your own code. Yes, you read that right; 'copy pasting'. 
	It is not a shame to not know things or to ask for help. 
	You're here to learn, so you should take on every opportunity to do so.
