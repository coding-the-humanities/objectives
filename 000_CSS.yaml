  This is the introduction to CSS (cascading style sheet). 
  A CSS file allows you to separate your web sites (X)HTML content from it’s style. 
  As always you use your HTML file to arrange the content, 
  but all of the presentation 
  (fonts, colors, background, borders, text formatting, link effects & so on…) are accomplished within a CSS.

  - title: CSS Selectors
    description: >
      In order for CSS to work you first need to specify which element you wish to apply CSS to.
      You do this with 'selectors'.
      Selectors are essentially just names for the things you want to target and affect.
      Within the {brackets} of selectors you place the effects you want to apply.
    instructions:
      - Watch the video.
      - Add some selectors to some basic html.

    description: >
      Colors give life to a page. 
      Black and white may be minimalistic and sleek, but the possibilities that arise when you add, say, 50 shades of grey,
      add so much to a website.

    instructions:
      - Read the articles
      - Write a short text about how to use selectors in CSS.
      - Color your webpage and the text you just wrote.

  - title: Gist
    description: >
      One way to share code with your peers and/or friends is to e-mail them the files.
      But mailing somebody files can become quite a hassle when you're dealing with a lot of files.
      Another way is to put it on Github, a website made for and by programmers to store and share code.
      Github supplies us with two ways to do that. The first is making a repository.
      The second way is Gist, which is a lot easier but has it's limitations.
    instructions:
      - Go to gist.github.com.
      - Copy paste the code you have written for these assignments into the box, or press 'Add File'.
      - Give the file the name Level0_CSS_assignment.html.
      - Write some snazzy description in the description box.
      - Click "Create public Gist" in the bottom right corner.
      - E-mail the link to >>>INSERTHEREOUREMAIL@CTH.NL<<< and/or your pals.
