  When you look at a web page in a web browser, you see, at the simplest level,
  words. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It tells the web browser 
  what content to display. In many cases a page also displays images or 
  maybe video. HTML separates "content" (words, images, audio, video, and so 
  on) from "presentation" (the definition of the type of content and the 
  instructions for how that type of content should be displayed). HTML uses a 
  pre-defined set of elements to identify content types.

      - Read the article.
      - Make a basic html structure containing a head and body.

      - Tag the headings with the h1, 2, 3 or 4 tags, and the paragraphs with the p tag.
      - Save the file, go to the folder it is in and double click on the file to open it in your browser.
      - Congratulations, you made a webpage!

      Linking is a way to reference to other stuff on the internet.

      You usually link to contextualize the content of your website.
    instructions:
      - Read the article
      - Make some links under the paragraphs in your text that reference to related subjects.

  - title: HTML Pictures
    description: >
      Everybody loves pictures. 
      People include pictures on their webpage to illustrate the content.
      You can include pictures with the <img> tag.
      The pictures can be retrieved from the internet, in which you use the hyperlink of the image.
      They can also be stored locally, in which case you put them in the same folder as your webpage and reference to their name.
    instructions:
      - Read the articles.
      - Look up on Google Images at least five pictures related to your text.
      - Include these pictures on your website, to better illustrate the content.

  - title: Gist
    description: >
      One way to share code with your peers and/or friends is to e-mail them the files.
      But mailing somebody files can become quite a hassle when you're dealing with a lot of files.
      Another way is to put it on Github, a website made for and by programmers to store and share code.
      Github supplies us with two ways to do that. The first is making a repository.
      The second way is Gist, which is a lot easier but has it's limitations.
    instructions:
      - Go to gist.github.com.
      - Copy paste the code you have written for these assignments into the box, or press 'Add File'.
      - Give the file the name "Level0_HTML_assignment.html".
      - Write some snazzy description in the description box.
      - Click "Create public Gist" in the bottom right corner.
      - E-mail the link to >>>INSERTHEREOUREMAIL@CTH.NL<<< and/or your pals.
