  When you look at a web page in a web browser, you see, at the simplest level,
  words. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It tells the web browser 
  what content to display. In many cases a page also displays images or 
  maybe video. HTML separates "content" (words, images, audio, video, and so 
  on) from "presentation" (the definition of the type of content and the 
  instructions for how that type of content should be displayed). HTML uses a 
  pre-defined set of elements to identify content types.
